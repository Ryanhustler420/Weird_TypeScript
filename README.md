# Weird_TypeScript
Typescript || Javascript


## Installing TypeScript

> npm -g install typescript

## Compile TypeScript To Javascript

> tsc script.ts

``
Make sure you are in that directory where the script.ts is located
``

## Make TypeScript .config file for all file compilation

``
npm --init
``
> now you can simply run 'tsc' and it will compile all the .ts file for you
